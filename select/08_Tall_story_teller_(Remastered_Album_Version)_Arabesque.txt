He's always telling stories
That's how he got his name - big Ballyhoo.
It's very very boring

It's ev'ry day the same - big Ballyhoo.
Whatever he is saying
He is telling a lie
But he tells you why it's true.
He is a tall story teller

He says that Rockefeller
Became a millionaire
'cause he gave him the tips
And he taught him the tricks.
He is a tall story teller -
Why do I love this feller?

I really don't low why
But I know it's true
That he loves me too
And that is not a lie.
So we are goin' to marry
Because I love this man - big Ballyhoo.
I said you're very caring
But you must understand - big Ballyhoo.
Be sure if you ever gonna tell me a lie
I'm saying good bye to you.
He is a tall story teller

Ballyhoo Ballyhoo - yes I love him
yes I do.
Ballyhoo Ballyhoo - and I know he loves me too.
He is a tall story teller
